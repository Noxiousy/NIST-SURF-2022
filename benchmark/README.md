# benchmark.py

To benchmark the FCPW and ZENO libraries, we used a Python script to run several commands simultaneously. 
The results are stored with well-commented .csv files. See **API** for outfile details

# API

## Command-Line Arguments

The script utilizes command-line arguments similar to that of the FCPW and ZENO executables. Use the following
pattern to run the script in Linux terminals:

```
python3 benchmark.py [.obj file] [queryType] [# of queries] [outfile (optional)]
```

[.obj file] specifies the .obj file to be passed to each command.
[queryType] specifies the query type to be passed to each command. This argument must be "contains" or "closest_point" exactly.
[# of queries] is an integer specifying the number of queries that will be generated by each command.
[outfile] specifies where the benchmark statistics will be written to. **This argument is optional** and, if left blank, 
will default to "benchmark.csv".

## Output

The output will be written to a .csv file specified by the user or to a default file. For more understandability, comments
are included in the file. These lines are denoted by "#".
