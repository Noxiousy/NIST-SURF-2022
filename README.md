# 2022 SURF Zeno

2022 SURF project on Zeno spatial data structures.

This repository contains an example program of the FCPW C++ library. Specifically,
it showcases how to create a 3D spatial index (called a Scene) with geometric shapes 
and how to query those shapes/vertices. `FastestClosestPoint/fcpw.cpp` contains "Closest 
Point" and "Contains" queries. 

The source code utilizes CMake, which also depends on the FCPW directory.
